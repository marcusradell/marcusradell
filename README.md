ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, you have reached Marcus Radell, Head of Curriculum at https://salt.dev. Please leave a message at my Discord: https://discord.com/invite/59hgZycxYJ.

My first programming milestone in open source was writing a preconfigured build setup using Gulp and Browserify. It was awesome, but I didn't really get how good it was until webpack came along. Here's the repo: https://github.com/marcusradell/mn-gulp. It's the first npm package I published as well.

One of the best (and last) code tests I did during this time used mn-gulp. I wrote components (directives) in Angular v1, which was rare at the time. I also broke out the logic out of the framework to keep the code organized. The code is pretty simple, but I'm still very proud of it: https://github.com/marcusradell/mn-lol.

I started to experiment with React and state management using reducers and streams. Here's some code I used for a presentation: https://github.com/marcusradell/talks-react-first-principles. I kept the code even more out of the framework now, which was a hard sell in the React community.

My state-management masterpiece was `rx-machine`. I used TypeScript, RxJS, and some patterns I invented for state management in React to write a really cool finite state machine lib. By accident, it turned out to be faster than all the popular form libs at the time. https://github.com/marcusradell/rx-machine. Here's the performance test on 1000 fields: https://codesandbox.io/s/rx-machine-1000-fields-8y9nj.

My most starred repo is a web server written in Rust: https://github.com/marcusradell/monadium_v1. I have made more progress in other repos, so ask me directly if you are interested.

I have done a talk in Swedish about junior developers and their careers: https://soundcloud.com/user-840142870/marcus-radell-utvecklares-karriarer. It's a topic I've been passionate about, and before working with it professionally, I mentored devs across the globe on my spare time.

My most recent contribution has been to try and document some TypeScript patterns that I've taught teams over the last years. Check out this specific branch called `final_modular_monolith`: https://github.com/marcusradell/code_typing/tree/final_modular_monolith.

I've also done a bit of live coding as I'm trying to collaborate more with people interested in writing quality code: https://www.youtube.com/live/KQFAHVMMpjs. It's a topic I hope to contribute more to in the future. You can find the code in the code typing repo above, but in the branch `final_hexagon`.

OK, time to stop stalking my GitHub profile! Developers, get back to coding! Recruiters, if you contact me, be prepared to hear about our great SALT developers (they're better than yours, but I have to charge)!
